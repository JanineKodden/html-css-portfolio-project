        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>A little bit about myself</h3>
        <p>
        I love being in the house with my boyfriend and pup taking care of my tropical plants. I love doing things creative and have tried lots of different things. Plants is a hobby that stuck around and hopefully I will love it for a lot more years to come. </br>
        </br>
        About my working life, </br>
        I have been working in retail since I got my first job at 15 years of age, in a restaurant. I have moved to parttime jobs in shops and ended in a position at a gasstation for 4 years, but now I feel like it is time to move on and challenge myself to learn something new! So, I have been trying to learn myself to code and it has been a fun challenge so far.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <h3>Background on my skills</h3>
        <p>I've started my MBO educations with Animation and Visual Design which I did for 3 years. Skills such as Video editing and knowledge of a lot of the Adobe programs were learned during that time.<br>
        <br>
        After that I got my degree within 2 years as a executive secretary. A totally different field, in that field I learned a lot in programs like Microsoft Word, Excel.<br>
        <br>
        Both of these had a lot to do with working with computers and programs they used. And now im working on the skill of programming.</p>
